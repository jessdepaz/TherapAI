## ðŸ›  Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run TherapAI locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/jessdepaz/TherapAI
cd TherapAI
```

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
To isolate dependencies, create and activate a virtual environment:

macOS/Linux:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Windows (CMD):

```
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Required Dependencies
Use pip to install the required packages:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

This installs Flask, Hugging Face transformers, and other necessary libraries.

### 4. Set Up Your OpenAI API Key
TherapAI requires an OpenAI API key to transcribe audio. Once you receive your key:

macOS/Linux:

```export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"```

Windows (CMD):

```set OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"```

ðŸ’¡ To avoid resetting every session, add the export/set command to your shell profile file (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc, or PowerShell profile).

### 5. Run the Application
Once everything is set up, start the Flask app:

``` python app.py```

Open your browser and go to: [http://127.0.0.1:5000]
You should now be able to upload audio or paste text for analysis.

# :closed_lock_with_key: Security Notes
Do not commit API keys â€” use environment variables. Never hardcode secrets in code.
Consider using a .env file and tools like python-dotenv for local development.

# :bar_chart: Example Use Case
A user uploads a therapy session audio file.

GPT-4o transcribes the session.

The app summarizes the session and highlights statements like:

"I realized Iâ€™ve been holding back."

"It became clear what I needed to do."

These insights are surfaced for therapist review or journaling.

## :pushpin: Future Improvements
